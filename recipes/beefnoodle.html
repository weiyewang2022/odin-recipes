    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Considered to be Taiwan’s national dish, beef noodle soup is a staple in restaurants, night markets, and food courts throughout the island country. You can easily find two or three adjacent food stalls serving their original variation on the dish with a devoted fanbase. There's even an annual Beef Noodle Festival, where chefs compete for the title of best beef noodle soup in Taiwan.

    <p>
        While the Taiwanese beef noodle soup has distinctly Sichuan influences, such as spicy bean paste (doubanjiang) and Sichuan peppercorns, the exact dish is nowhere to be found in the Chinese province. That’s because the dish originated from Sichuan veterans who fled to Taiwan from mainland China during the 1940s civil war. Taiwanese beef noodle soup was one of the treasures that emerged from the inter-provincial community and culture that evolved out of the military settlements where soldiers and their families lived.
